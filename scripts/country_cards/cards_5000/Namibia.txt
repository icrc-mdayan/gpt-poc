Health Information in Namibia
Life Expectancy: Estimated at 64 years in 2017, among the lowest in the world.
National Health Extension Programme: Launched in 2012, it deployed 1,800 health extension workers by 2015, with a goal of 4,800 workers trained in community health activities including first aid, disease prevention, nutritional assessment, water sanitation, HIV testing, and community-based antiretroviral treatment.
Non-Communicable Diseases:
Hypertension and Elevated Blood Pressure: 44% of women and 45% of men aged 35–64 have elevated blood pressure or are on medication. A significant portion (49% of women and 61% of men) are unaware of their condition. Only 29% of women and 20% of men with hypertension have their condition under control.
Diabetes: 6% of women and 7% of men are diabetic. An additional 7% of women and 6% of men are prediabetic. Most individuals with diabetes (67% of women and 74% of men) are on medication.
Obesity: Individuals with a body mass index of 25.0 or higher are more likely to have elevated blood pressure and fasting blood glucose.
HIV/AIDS:
Remains a public health issue despite expanded treatment services.
In 2001, an estimated 210,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS, with 16,000 deaths in 2003.
In 2013, HIV prevalence among adults aged 15–49 was 13.3%. Prevalence among women aged 15–49 was 16.9% and among men 10.9%. Prevalence peaks in the 35–39 age group (30.9% for women and 22.6% for men).
HIV prevalence is higher in urban areas compared to rural areas and is lower among circumcised men.
The HIV epidemic has led to an increase in the number of orphans.
Malaria: The risk of contracting malaria is 14.5% higher in individuals infected with HIV, and the risk of death from malaria is increased by approximately 50% in those with concurrent HIV infection.
Healthcare Workforce: As of 2002, Namibia had only 598 physicians.
Namibia faces significant health challenges, including a high burden of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be a major public health issue, with substantial impacts on the population's health and an interplay with malaria. Efforts to improve health include the deployment of health extension workers and expanded HIV treatment services.
