Health [ edit ] Main article: Health in Burundi Burundi has the worst hunger and malnourishment rates of all 120 countries ranked in the Global Hunger Index .  The civil war in 1962 put a stop on the medical advancements in the country.  Burundi, again, went into a violent cycle in 2015, jeopardising the citizens of Burundi's medical care.  Like other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Burundi uses indigenous medicine in addition to biomedicine . In the 1980s, Burundi's health authorities asked the United Nations Development Program for support to develop quality control for and begin new research on pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants.  At the same time, the Burundi Association of Traditional Practitioners (ATRADIBU) was founded, which teamed up with the governments agency to set up the Centre for Research and Promotion of Traditional Medicine in Burundi (CRPMT).  The recent influx of international aid has supported the work of biomedical health systems in Burundi. However, international aid workers have traditionally stayed away from indigenous medicine in Burundi.  As of 2015, roughly 1 out of 10 children in Burundi die before the age of 5 from preventable and treatable illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria.  The current violence in Burundi has limited the country's access to medication and hospital equipment. The life expectancy in Burundi, as of 2015, was 60.1 years.  In 2013, Burundi spent 8% of their GDP on healthcare.  While Burundi's fertility rate is 6.1 children per women, the country's infant mortality rate is 61.9 deaths for every 1,000 live births.  Common diseases in Burundi include malaria and typhoid fever.
