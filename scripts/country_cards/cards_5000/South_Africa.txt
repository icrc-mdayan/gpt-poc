Health Information in South Africa
Life Expectancy:
In 2009, life expectancy was 71 years for white South Africans and 48 years for black South Africans.
Healthcare Spending:
Approximately 9% of GDP is spent on healthcare.
84% of the population relies on the public healthcare system, which faces chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.
20% of the population uses private healthcare.
16% of the population is covered by medical aid schemes; the rest pay out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans.
HIV/AIDS:
South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world, with an estimated seven million people affected.
In 2018, HIV prevalence among adults (15â€“49 years) was 20.4%.
71,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2018.
HIV infection rates are divided along racial lines: 13.6% of blacks and 0.3% of whites are HIV-positive.
There are an estimated 1,200,000 AIDS orphans in South Africa.
Government efforts to combat HIV/AIDS include increasing funding for and widening the scope of HIV treatment, leading to an increase in life expectancy from 52.1 years to 62.5 years by 2015.
Healthcare System:
Public healthcare is characterized by significant resource limitations and chronic human resource shortages.
Private healthcare is dominated by three hospital groups: Mediclinic, Life Healthcare, and Netcare, which control 75% of the private hospital market.
South Africa faces significant health challenges, particularly related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has heavily impacted life expectancy and created a large number of orphans. The healthcare system is strained, with a large reliance on an under-resourced public sector and a smaller, yet more controlled, private healthcare sector.
