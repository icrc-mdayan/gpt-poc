Health Information in Uganda
Healthcare Resources:
There were eight physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s.
The elimination of user fees at state health facilities in 2001 led to an 80% increase in visits, particularly benefiting the poorest 20% of the population.
Healthcare Challenges:
Patients often need to provide their own medical equipment.
Poor communication within hospitals and low satisfaction with health services undermine care quality.
Distance to health service providers is a significant issue, especially for the poor and elderly.
Life Expectancy:
Estimated to be 63.4 years in 2019.
Infant Mortality:
Approximately 61 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.
Disease Outbreaks:
Ebola: Outbreak in July 2012 in the Kibaale District with at least 16 deaths.
Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever: Suspected outbreak in August 2013 in northern Uganda.
HIV/AIDS:
Infection rates dropped from 30% in the 1980s to 6.4% by the end of 2008.
The use of contraceptives among sexually active unmarried women is less than half, with a significant disparity between poor (15%) and wealthy women (40%).
Approximately 40% of births are unplanned, and unsafe abortions account for 8% of maternal deaths.
Maternal Health:
Approximately 6,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related complications.
Efforts to reduce maternal mortality include voucher schemes for health services and transport to clinics.
Female Genital Mutilation (FGM):
Low prevalence, with only 1% of women having undergone FGM, which is illegal in Uganda.
Uganda has made significant strides in healthcare access and reducing HIV/AIDS infection rates. However, the country still faces challenges related to healthcare quality, disease outbreaks, maternal health, and access to medical resources.
