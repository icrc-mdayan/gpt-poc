Health Main articles: Healthcare in Somalia and Child marriage in Somalia Life expectancy in Somalia, 1950 to 2019 Until the collapse of the federal government in 1991, the organizational and administrative structure of Somalia's healthcare sector was overseen by the Ministry of Health. Regional medical officials enjoyed some authority, but healthcare was largely centralized. The socialist government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre had put an end to private medical practice in 1972.  Much of the national budget was devoted to military expenditure, leaving few resources for healthcare, among other services.  Somalia's public healthcare system was largely destroyed during the ensuing civil war. As with other previously nationalized sectors, informal providers have filled the vacuum and replaced the former government monopoly over healthcare, with access to facilities witnessing a significant increase.  Many new healthcare centres, clinics, hospitals and pharmacies have in the process been established through home-grown Somali initiatives.  The cost of medical consultations and treatment in these facilities is low, at $5.72 per visit in health centres (with a population coverage of 95%), and $1.89–3.97 per outpatient visit and $7.83–13.95 per bed day in primary through tertiary hospitals.  Comparing the 2005–2010 period with the half-decade just prior to the outbreak of the conflict (1985–1990), life expectancy actually increased from an average of 47 years for men and women to 48.2 years for men and 51 years for women.   Similarly, the number of one-year-olds fully immunized against measles rose from 30% in 1985–1990 to 40% in 2000–2005,   and for tuberculosis , it grew nearly 20% from 31% to 50% over the same period.   The number of infants with low birth weight fell from 16 per 1,000 to 0.3, a 15% drop in total over the same time frame.   Between 2005 and 2010 as compared to the 1985–1990 period, infant mortality per 1,000 births also fell from 152 to 109.6.   Significantly, maternal mortality per 100,000 births fell from 1,600 in the pre-war 1985–1990 half-decade to 1,100 in the 2000–2005 period.   The number of physicians per 100,000 people also rose from 3.4 to 4 over the same time frame,   as did the percentage of the population with access to sanitation services, which increased from 18% to 26%.   According to United Nations Population Fund data on the midwifery workforce, there is a total of 429 midwives (including nurse-midwives) in Somalia, with a density of one midwife per 1,000 live births. Eight midwifery institutions presently exist in the country, two of which are private. Midwifery is regulated by the government, and a license is required to practice professionally. A live registry is also in place to keep track of licensed midwives. In addition, midwives in the country are officially represented by a local midwives association, with 350 registered members.  According to a 2005 World Health Organization estimate, about 97.9% of Somalia's women and girls underwent Female genital mutilation ,  a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to the horn of Africa and parts of the Near East.   Encouraged by women in the community, it is primarily intended to protect chastity, deter promiscuity, and offer protection from assault.   By 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern Puntland and Somaliland regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign.  About 93% of Somalia's male population is also reportedly circumcised.  Somalia has one of the lowest HIV infection rates on the continent. This is attributed to the Muslim nature of Somali society and adherence of Somalis to Islamic morals.  While the estimated HIV prevalence rate in Somalia in 1987 (the first case report year) was 1% of adults,  a 2012 report from UNAIDS says that since 2004, estimates from 0.7% to 1% have been assumed.  Although healthcare is now largely concentrated in the private sector, the country's public healthcare system is in the process of being rebuilt, and is overseen by the Ministry of Health. The Minister of Health is Qamar Adan Ali.  The autonomous Puntland region maintains its own Ministry of Health,  as does the Somaliland region in northwestern Somalia.  Some of the prominent healthcare facilities in the country are East Bardera Mothers and Children's Hospital , Abudwak Maternity and Children's Hospital , Edna Adan Maternity Hospital and West Bardera Maternity Unit .
