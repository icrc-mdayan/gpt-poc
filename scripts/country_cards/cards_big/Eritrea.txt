Health Main article: Health in Eritrea Eritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for health, in particular child health.  Life expectancy at birth increased from 39.1 years in 1960 to 66.44 years in 2020;  maternal and child mortality rates dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure expanded.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2008 found average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years, a number that has increased to 66.44 in 2020.  [ failed verification ] Immunisation and child nutrition have been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the prevalence of underweight children decreased by 12% from 1995 to 2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%).  The National Malaria Protection Unit of the Ministry of Health registered reductions in malarial mortality by as much as 85% and in the number of cases by 92% between 1998 and 2006.  The Eritrean government has banned female genital mutilation (FGM), saying the practice was painful and put women at risk of life-threatening health problems.  However, Eritrea still faces many challenges. Although the number of physicians increased from only 0.2 in 1993 to 0.5 in 2004 per 1000 people, this is still very low.  Malaria and tuberculosis are common.  HIV prevalence for ages 15 to 49 years exceeds 2%.  The fertility rate is about 4.1 births per woman.  Maternal mortality dropped by more than half from 1995 to 2002, but is still high.  Similarly, the number of births attended by skilled health personnel doubled from 1995 to 2002, but still is only 28.3%.  A major cause of death in newborns is severe infection .  Per-capita expenditure on health is low.
