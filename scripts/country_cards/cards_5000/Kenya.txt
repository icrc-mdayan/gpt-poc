Health Information in Kenya
Healthcare Budget: In 2019/2020, health care was allocated 4.8% of the national budget, or 4.59% of GDP, which is below both the Sub-Saharan Africa average (4.98%) and the global average (9.83%).
Health Expenditure: In FY 2020/21, county health expenditure was distributed as follows:
58% on Policy Planning and Administrative Support Services
28% on Curative and Rehabilitative Health Services
8% on Preventive and Promotive Health Services
7% on Other Programmes
Health Funding: Health care is primarily funded by private individuals, employers, the National Health Insurance Fund, medical insurance companies, and some government social safety net schemes.
Public and Private Healthcare: Public hospitals operate on a fee-for-service basis, generating significant revenue. Private health facilities are diverse and dynamic. Public facilities are categorized from community-based services (Level I) to national referral hospitals (Level VI).
Healthcare Workforce: Nurses are the largest group of front-line healthcare providers, followed by clinical officers, medical officers, and medical practitioners. Traditional healers are also widely consulted.
Health Challenges:
Life expectancy dropped to approximately 55 years in 2009.
Infant mortality rate was approximately 44 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.
In 2011, only 42% of births were attended by skilled health professionals.
Prevalent Diseases: Preventable diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition are major health burdens.
HIV/AIDS: In 2009, HIV/AIDS prevalence was about 6.3% of the adult population, though the epidemic may be improving with declining prevalence among young people and pregnant women.
Malaria: Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006.
Maternal Health: High maternal mortality rates are partly attributed to female genital mutilation, which affected about 27% of women but has been declining and was banned in 2011.
Kenya faces numerous health challenges, including a significant burden from preventable diseases, weak health policies, and underfunding of the healthcare sector.
