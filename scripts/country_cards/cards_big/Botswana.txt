Health [ edit ] Botswana's healthcare system has been steadily improving and expanding,  specifically in the fact that the infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are steadily declining.  85 per cent of the population live within a 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) radius of a health facility. 73 per cent of pregnant women access antenal care services at least four times. Almost 100 per cent of births in Botswana take place in hospitals.  Scottish Livingstone Hospital in Molepolole The Ministry of Health  in Botswana is responsible for overseeing the quality and distribution of healthcare throughout the country. Life expectancy at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.  After Botswana's 2011 census, current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.  The Cancer Association of Botswana is a voluntary non-governmental organisation . The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of cancer prevention and health awareness programs, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counselling to those affected.  HIV/AIDS epidemic [ edit ] Main article: HIV/AIDS in Botswana Life expectancy in select Southern African countries, 1950–2019. HIV/AIDS has caused a fall in life expectancy. Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the economic impact of AIDS is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. Botswana has been hit very hard by the AIDS pandemic ; in 2006, it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.  The life expectancy is 66.4 years as of 2024.  In 2003, the government began a comprehensive programme involving free or cheap generic antiretroviral drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus; in 2013, over 40% of adults in Botswana had access to antiretroviral therapy.  : 28 In the age group of 15–19 years old, prevalence was estimated at 6% for females and 3.5% for males in 2013,  : 33 and for the 20–24 age group, 15% for females and 5% for males.  : 33 Botswana is one of 21 priority countries identified by the UN AIDS group in 2011 in the Global Plan to eliminate new HIV infections among children and to keep their mothers alive.  : 37 From 2009 to 2013, the country saw a decrease over 50% in new HIV infections in children.  : 38 Less than 10% of pregnant HIV-infected women were not receiving antiretroviral medications in 2013, with a corresponding large decrease (over 50%) in the number of new HIV infections in children under 5.  : 39, 40 Among the UN Global Plan countries, people living with HIV in Botswana have the highest per centage receiving antiretroviral treatment: about 75% for adults (age 15+) and about 98% for children.  : 237 With a nationwide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program, Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% in 2003 to 4% in 2010. Under the leadership of Festus Mogae , the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in curing people with HIV/AIDS and received early support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Merck Foundation, which together formed the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (ACHAP). Other early partners include the Botswana–Harvard AIDS Institute of the Harvard School of Public Health and the Botswana–UPenn Partnership of the University of Pennsylvania . According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment—defined as 80% coverage or greater—has been achieved in Botswana.  The country has been adversely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic . In 2002, Botswana became the first country to offer anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) to help combat the epidemic.  Despite the launch of programs to make treatment available and to educate the populace about the epidemic,  the number of people with AIDS rose from 290,000 in 2005 to 320,000 in 2013.  : A20 However, in recent years the country has made strides in combating HIV/AIDS, with efforts being made to provide proper treatment and lower the rate of mother-to-child transmission.
