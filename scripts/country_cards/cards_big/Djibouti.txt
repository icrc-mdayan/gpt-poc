In Djibouti the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 6 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 93.  About 93.1% of Djibouti's women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM, sometimes referred to as 'female circumcision'),  a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East.   Although legally proscribed in 1994, the procedure is still widely practiced, as it is deeply ingrained in the local culture.  Encouraged and performed by women in the community, FGM is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.   About 94% of Djibouti's male population have also reportedly undergone male circumcision , a figure in line with adherence to Islam; the Shafi'i school of Islam , the predominant madhhab in the Horn of Africa, requires circumcision of males and females.
