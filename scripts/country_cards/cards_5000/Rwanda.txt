Health Information in Rwanda
Historical Context: Healthcare quality was very low before and immediately after the 1994 genocide. In 1998, over one in five children died before their fifth birthday, often from malaria.
Healthcare Spending: Increased to 6.5% of GDP in 2013 from 1.9% in 1996.
Health Insurance System: "Mutuelles de santé" system, piloted in 1999 and nationwide by mid-2000s, covers over 90% of the population as of 2014. Premiums vary on a sliding scale based on income.
Training Institutes: Established institutions like Kigali Health Institute (now part of the University of Rwanda) for training healthcare professionals.
Key Health Indicators:
Life Expectancy: Increased from 55.2 in 2005 to 64.0 in 2013.
Under-5 Mortality: Decreased from 106.4 to 52.0 per 1,000 live births between 2005 and 2013.
Tuberculosis: Incidence dropped from 101 to 69 per 100,000 people.
Communicable Diseases: Dominant in Rwanda's health profile.
Malaria: Major cause of child mortality; the Presidents' Malaria Initiative provides prevention materials to rural areas.
HIV/AIDS: Ongoing epidemic, with significant challenges remaining despite progress. Maternal mortality remains high.
Healthcare Workforce: Shortage with only 0.84 physicians, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 residents.
Health Recommendations for Travelers: CDC recommends preventive malaria medication and vaccines for yellow fever.
UN Millennium Development Goals:
Not on target for goal 4 (infant mortality reduction) despite significant decreases.
Making good progress towards goal 5 (reducing maternal mortality).
Goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS) not yet met; HIV prevalence remains high.
Rwanda has made notable improvements in healthcare, particularly in life expectancy, child mortality, and tuberculosis incidence. However, the country continues to face significant challenges with communicable diseases, maternal mortality, and healthcare workforce shortages. The mutuelles de santé insurance system and international partnerships play crucial roles in advancing Rwanda's healthcare system.
