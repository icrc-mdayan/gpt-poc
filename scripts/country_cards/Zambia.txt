Health [ edit ] Main articles: Health in Zambia and Healthcare in Zambia Zambia is experiencing a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a national HIV prevalence rate of 12.10 per cent among adults.  However, the country has made progress over the past decade: The prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS for adults aged 15–49 decreased to 13 per cent in 2013/14, compared to 16 per cent roughly a decade earlier.  Other health outcomes have also improved significantly, despite remaining poor by global standards. The maternal mortality rate in 2014 was 398 per 100,000 live births, compared to 591 in 2007; over the same period, the mortality rate of children under five dropped to 75 from 119 per 1,000 live births. [ citation needed ] Economy [ edit ] Further information: Economy of Zambia In 2022, Zambia averages between $7.5 billion and $8 billion of exports annually.   It totaled $9.1 billion worth of exports in 2018.  In  2015, about 54.4% of Zambians lived below the recognised national poverty line, improved from 60.5% in 2010.  Rural poverty rates were about 76.6% and urban rates at about 23.4%.  The national poverty line was ZMK 214 (USD 12.85) per month.  As of the latest estimate in 2018 by the United Nations Development Programme , 47.9 percent of the population continued to be affected by multidimensional poverty . Unemployment and underemployment in urban areas are serious problems.  Most rural Zambians are subsistence farmers.

Zambia was ranked 118th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.  Social indicators continue to decline, particularly in measurements of life expectancy at birth (about 40.9 years) and maternal mortality (830 per 100,000 pregnancies).  Zambia fell into poverty after international copper prices declined in the 1970s. The socialist regime made up for falling revenue with several abortive attempts at International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programs (SAPs). The policy of not trading through the main supply route and line of rail to the sea – the territory was known as Rhodesia (from 1965 to 1979), and now known as Zimbabwe – cost the economy greatly. After the Kaunda regime, (from 1991) successive governments began limited reforms. The economy stagnated until the late 1990s. In 2007 Zambia recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth. Inflation was 8.9%, down from 30% in 2000.  Zambia is still dealing with economic reform issues such as the size of the public sector, and improving Zambia's social sector delivery systems.  Economic regulations and red tape are extensive, and corruption is widespread. The bureaucratic procedures surrounding the process of obtaining licences encourages the widespread use of facilitation payments.  Zambia's total foreign debt exceeded $6 billion when the country qualified for Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) debt relief in 2000, contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria. Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003. GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100) In January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing the number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.  The Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia's rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power. In July 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Zambia's President Edgar Lungu signed 12 agreements in capital Lusaka on areas ranging from trade and investment to tourism and diplomacy.   Mining [ edit ] The major Nkana open copper mine, Kitwe . The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper mining industry.  In 2003, exports of nonmetals increased by 25% and accounted for 38% of all export earnings, previously 35%. The Zambian government has recently [ when? ] been granting licenses to international resource companies to prospect for minerals such as nickel, tin, copper, and uranium.  The government of Zambia hopes that nickel will take over from copper as the country's top metallic export.  In 2009, Zambia was badly hit by the world economic crisis .  As Zambia's economy is heavily dependent on the copper industry, the national exchange rate changes in accordance with the copper price.  Agriculture [ edit ] Agriculture plays a very important part in Zambia's economy providing many more jobs than the mining industry. A small number of white Zimbabwean farmers were welcomed into Zambia after their expulsion by Robert Mugabe, whose numbers had reached roughly 150 to 300 people as of 2004 [update] .   They farm a variety of crops including tobacco, wheat, and chili peppers on an estimated 150 farms. The skills they brought, combined with general economic liberalisation under the late Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa , has been credited with stimulating an agricultural boom in Zambia. In 2004, for the first time in 26 years, Zambia exported more corn than it imported.  In December 2019, the Zambian government unanimously decided to legalize cannabis for medicinal and export purposes only.  Tourism [ edit ] Further information: Tourism in Zambia Victoria Falls (Mosi-oa-Tunya Falls) a UNESCO World Heritage Site The tourism industry is a major and growing industry in Zambia. Zambia has  several National parks (The North Luangwa , South Luangwa and Kafue ), waterfalls , lakes , rivers , and historic monuments .  Tourism is being seen by Zambia's government as a tool for economic and rural development, as it generates income, creates jobs, promotes wildlife conservation, and improves standards of living.  The increasingly popular worldwide phenomenon of adventure tourism has also risen in popularity within Zambia, especially within the city of Livingstone, which is now becoming known as Africa's "adventure tourism capital".  Energy [ edit ] See also: List of power stations in Zambia In 2009, Zambia generated 10.3 TWh of electricity and has been rated high in use of both solar power and hydroelectricity.  However, early 2015 [update] , Zambia began experiencing a serious energy shortage due to the poor 2014/2015 rain season, which resulted in low water levels at the Kariba dam and other major dams.  In September 2019, African Green Resources (AGR) announced that it would invest $150 million in 50 megawatt (MW) solar farm, along with irrigation dam and expanding the existing grain silo capacity by 80,000 tonnes.
